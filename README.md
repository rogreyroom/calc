# Calculator project

The project is a Calculator app. It is based on a [free psd concept](https://creativetacos.com/free-calculator-psd/). The goal was to code it with any technology. It should be responsive without the use of any graphics as well as it should have hover effects.
I have decided to code the app with the use of html, scss, vanilla javascript. To bundle the project I decided to use the [parcel bundler](parceljs.org) as it is easy to use and hassle-free.

If you want, you can get the application repo and play around.
